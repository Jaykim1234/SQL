# SQL


-	DISTINCT removes duplicates
-	WHERE restricts rows returned
-	Joins:
o	A JOIN B
o	Cross Join:
	Only puts tables side by side
	Like SELECT * From A,B
	SELECT * FROM A CROSS JOIN B





o	Natural Join
	Retrieves rows where id matches
	More meaningful
	Like SELECT a.col1, acolna FROM A,B where A.col1=B.col1…
	Select * FROM A INNER JOIN B USING (col1,col2..)
o	Inner Join
